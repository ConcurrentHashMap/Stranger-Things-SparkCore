## Project

This is a Halloween project by [Laurel Hart](http://konahart.com), inspired
by Netflix's Stranger Things. 

Special thanks to ["Arduino Based Stranger Things Lights"](http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Based-Stranger-Things-Lights) and [reddit: Comment on 'REQUEST Set of Christmas lights that -- you know -- do something like this....'](https://www.reddit.com/r/StrangerThings/comments/4zm7ss/request_set_of_christmas_lights_that_you_know_do/d6wzesr/) for giving me a jumping-off point for this project. 

## Website design

The [Ink Theme](http://github.com/thinker3197/Ink) is a simple & minimalistic theme for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator.

>Designed and developed by [@thinker3197](https://github.com/thinker3197).
