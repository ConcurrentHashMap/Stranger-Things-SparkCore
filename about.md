## Project

This is a Halloween project by <a href="konahart.com">Laurel Hart</a>, inspired
by Netflix's Stranger Things. 

Special thanks to ["Arduino Based Stranger Things Lights"](http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Based-Stranger-Things-Lights) and [reddit: Comment on 'REQUEST Set of Christmas lights that -- you know -- do something like this....'](https://www.reddit.com/r/StrangerThings/comments/4zm7ss/request_set_of_christmas_lights_that_you_know_do/d6wzesr/) for giving me a jumping-off point for this project. 

## Website design

<p class="heavy-title">The <a href="http://github.com/thinker3197/Ink">Ink Theme</a> is a simple & minimalistic theme for <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, a static site generator.</p>

>Designed and developed by [@thinker3197](https://github.com/thinker3197).
